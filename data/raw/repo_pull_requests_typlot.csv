This was a problem for Toytree because I would routinely plot text with style `{'text-anchor': 'start', '-toyplot-anchor-shift': '20px'}`. 

This problem is also apparent in the example for `-toyplot-anchor-shift` from the Toyplot documentation:

```Python
canvas = toyplot.Canvas(width=500, height=300)
axes = canvas.cartesian(show=False, ymin=-2.5, ymax=1.5)
axes.vlines(0, color=""lightgray"")
axes.text(0, 1, ""Shifted +0px"", style={""-toyplot-anchor-shift"":""0"", ""text-anchor"":""start"", ""font-size"":""24px""})
axes.scatterplot(0, 1, color=""black"", size=3)
m0 = axes.text(0, 0, ""Shifted +20px"", style={""-toyplot-anchor-shift"":""20px"", ""text-anchor"":""start"", ""font-size"":""24px""})
axes.scatterplot(0, 0, color=""black"", size=3)
m1 = axes.text(0, -1, ""Shifted +40px"", style={""-toyplot-anchor-shift"":""40px"", ""text-anchor"":""start"", ""font-size"":""24px""})
axes.scatterplot(0, -1, color=""black"", size=3);
axes.text(0, -2, ""Shifted -20px"", style={""-toyplot-anchor-shift"":""-20px"", ""text-anchor"":""start"", ""font-size"":""24px""})
axes.scatterplot(0, -2, color=""black"", size=3);
```

The marker extents do not take into account the anchor shift. You can see the right value is unchanged for `m0` and `m1`:
```
>>> m0.extents('x')[1], m1.extents('x')[1]
```
```
((array([ 0.]), array([ 147.432]), array([-14.4]), array([ 14.4])),
 (array([ 0.]), array([ 147.432]), array([-14.4]), array([ 14.4])))
```

After making the edit that is in the pull request the extents seem to appropriately valued:
```
>>> m0.extents('x')[1], m1.extents('x')[1]
```
```
((array([ 0.]), array([ 167.432]), array([-14.4]), array([ 14.4])),
 (array([ 0.]), array([ 187.432]), array([-14.4]), array([ 14.4])))
```
