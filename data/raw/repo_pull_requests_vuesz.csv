Background:

- SIP 5.0.0 was released on 2019-10-08.
- SIP 6.0.0 was released on 2021-01-04.
- SIP developer [wrote](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2020-September/043162.html) in September 2020:
  > SIP v4 has been deprecated for more than a year. *Nobody* should still be using it.
- In #433 I added support for SIP v5. The code used `sip5` legacy tool that was present in SIP v5 for compatibility with v4.
- In SIP v6, that tool is not present. So we have two ways: either use SIP's own buildsystem (`sip-build` command-line tool), or use the `sipbuild` API from Python. Here I went with the second approach.

To test this, try installing the latest versions of `sip`, `PyQt5` and `PyQt5.sip` from PyPI. On Debian, install `python3-sipbuild` from experimental (it may want to remove `sip5-tools`, if you need that package its new name is `sip-tools`).",3,1,[]

This pull request is an answer to https://github.com/veusz/veusz/issues/395#issue-589261447
This update enables
- copying a plot page to the clipboard as images
- pasting an clipboard image on the plot page.

I think it would be useful when users want to frequently exchange images with other software.

# Copy as image
## Behavior
- ""Copy as Image"" menu appears when a user right click on the tree edit window.
- ""Ctrl + Alt + C"" is assigned to the shortcut of this action.
- DPI and other parameters depend on the settings of usual ""export"".
- ""Copy as Image"" exports the selected page as 3 types of images, and copies them to clipboard as 4 types of mime data
    - ""image/svg+xml"" (.svg)
    - ""image/png"" (.png)
    - ""PNG"" (.png)
    - ""image/x-bmp"" (.bmp)
- I checked that either of the 4 mime type can be pasted to major software, as shown below.

|  | image/svg+xml | image/png | PNG | image/x-bmp |
----|----|----|----|----|
| Inkscape | ok | ok | ok | ok |
| GIMP (on Ubuntu) | NG | ok | ok | ok |
| GIMP (on Windows) | NG | NG | ok | ok |
| LibreOffice (on Ubuntu)  | NG | ok | NG | NG |
| LibreOffice (on Windows) | NG | NG | ok | NG |
| MS Office (-2016) | NG | NG | ok | NG |
| MS Office (2019-, 365) | ok | NG | ok | NG |

## Changed files
- veusz.windows.treeeditwindow.py

## Known concerns & points to be discussed
- The images are exported as overall page, even when only several widgets in the page are selected. 
- I implemented ""Copy as Image"" separately from ""Copy"". Integrating them into ""Copy"" (always copy widget and image simulataneously) might be simpler. 

# Paste
## Behavior
- If clipboard contains image mime types, ""Paste"" action (on the tree edit window) convert the data to veusz ""imagefile"" widget, and then paste it.
- The program searches mime types in the following priority order:
    - 'text/x-vnd.veusz-widget-3', 'image/svg+xml', 'image/png', 'PNG', 'image/x‑xpixmap', 'image/x-bmp', 'image/x‑xbm', 'image/x‑xbitmap', 'image/tiff',  'image/jpeg', 'JFIF', 'GIF'
- I checked that images from major software (as shown below) can be correctly pasted.
    - Inkscape (as svg)
    - GIMP (as raster)
    - LibreOffice (as raster)
    - MS Office 2016 (as raster)
    - MS Office 2019, 365 (as svg)
    - Print-screen (not works on Windows)
    - Firefox, Chrome (not works on Windows)

## Changed files
- veusz.document.mime.py

## Known concerns & points to be discussed
- Print-screen images or copied images from web-browsers cannot be pasted on MS WIndows.
  It is because Windows HBITMAP format is not supported so far. HBITMAP data are not accessible by PyQt qt.QApplication.clipboard().mimeData().",5,5,[]

Veusz has powerful figure composing ability, in addition to the excellent plotting functions. Therefore, I think some users will have benefit if veusz can import an external vector-based images (e.g. chemical structures) without rasterizing. Although the ""add imagefile"" function also can import .svg vector graphics, it rasterizes the images and sometimes makes their resolutions low.

This PR implements `SVGFile` class, which is similar to `ImageFile` class.
- The `SVGFile` instances can be added by ""Add svgfile"" button in the shape tools menu.
- The `SVGFile` instances are rendered by `QSvgRenderer`.
- The `SVGFile` instances are encoded into base64 data with type of `svgfile`.

The imported image can be rendered and embedded as a vector image as shown in the picture below.

`SVGFile` is implemented separately from `ImageFile` class to keep the backward compatibility and reduce unnecessary conditional branches. The newly added code in the `veusz.widgets.shape` may need to have more sophisticated (many of the method in the `SVGFile` and `ImageFile` are duplicated). I left it as is so far because I am new to the veusz policy for code design (e.g. Are function overloads discouraged or not?). I think there are some options. I would like to discuss how to improve it. 

I would appreciate if you consider adding this function.

Many Thanks!

For this to work effectively, the hide checkbox should always be at the same place and easily reachable. IMHO this best place is at the very top of the settings, but #92 has a different idea (at the bottom – but then you always have to scroll down to the bottom …)

This PR implements this with the check box(es) always at the top. If the check box should be at the bottom, the method `setting.settings.Settings.getNames()` should be changed from
```python
    def getNames(self):
        """"""Return list of names.""""""
        return self.hideboxnames + self.setnames

to
```python
    def getNames(self):
        """"""Return list of names.""""""
        return self.setnames + self.hideboxnames

This could be even made a configuration option? But then I am not sure, if the reversal of

With this change, children of a plotter will be drawn as well.

This is very useful to us, because we created objects related to a curve which have to be children of it.
For example we created a datapoint object used to find and describe some particular points of a curve (minimum, maximum, etc...).

To avoid this misunderstanding, we changed the cursor with the cross one.

Probably a better solution would be to find a cursor with an arrow and a magnifying glass, but it isn't included in Qt defaults.

I wasn't sure whether it would make sense to have the fallback on PyFITS if Astropy is not installed or whether we should do a clean break and simply require Astropy? (I'm happy to update this PR).

I had issues building veusz (will open a separate issue) so cannot test that this works correctly at the moment - but maybe you make use of Travis?

I just implemented the table.load.votable SAMP call, so that data can be sent from applications such as Topcat.  I noticed that the D-Bus interface appears to register each window, but for simplicity I started with just registering once with SAMP for the whole application, and loading the data into the first available window.

Then I had to add a plugin to actually read the VO table files, which checks that the astropy modules are available to do so.  The VO table file could potentially include several tables, but I wasn't sure whether I should attempt to separate the datasets loaded from the different tables.  Currently the plugin just returns all of the individual datasets with their original names.
